# gnss-nav-py
Decoder for GNSS Navigation messages

The plan of this module for the upcoming months will be to implement the following:

- GNSS Navigation message parser for the main GNSS-signals:
  - GPS: LNAV, CNAV, CNAV2
  - GAL: F/NAV, I/NAV
  - GLON: NAV
  - BeiDou: D1, D2

- for every gnss-receiver supporting raw-nav data output
- Rinex-nav data export 

Since I have recently started with my thesis, I will unfortunately not have time to implement the project the upcoming months. The plan would be to finish a first draft in early 2022.


Contributions are welcome :)
